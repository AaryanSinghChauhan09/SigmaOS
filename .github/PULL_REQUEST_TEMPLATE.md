## Motivation

<!-- Link the issue, roadmap item, or gap-analysis entry. Upstream study / Reference study / What SigmaOS adopts. -->

## Implementation notes

<!-- Design decisions, data structures, locking, error handling. -->

## Tests

- [ ] Unit tests added/updated
- [ ] Integration tests added/updated
- [ ] Concurrency/stress tests added/updated
- [ ] Fuzz tests added/updated
- [ ] Boot smoke test performed, if kernel-facing
- [ ] No regression in existing tests

## File safety review

- [ ] Lifecycle transitions are valid
- [ ] Zombies are eventually reaped
- [ ] Orphans are adopted
- [ ] PID reuse is safe
- [ ] Lock ordering is documented
- [ ] Interrupt-context safety considered
- [ ] Signal races considered
- [ ] Double-unlink prevented
- [ ] Resource limits enforced
- [ ] No unbounded allocation or recursion

## Verification

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo check --lib
cargo test --lib
./run_sigma_tests.sh
```

## Capability status

- Previous status:
- New status:
- Evidence:

## Integration impact

- [ ] No runtime integration yet
- [ ] Connected to runtime path
- [ ] Boot path validated
- [ ] Installer/update path validated
- [ ] Hardware tested

## Safety and rollback

- [ ] Safety guarantees and rollback steps documented

## Reviewer checklist

- [ ] Scope is narrow
- [ ] Public API documented
- [ ] `unsafe` justified
- [ ] Lock ordering documented
- [ ] Error paths tested
- [ ] Feature status updated
- [ ] No unsupported compatibility claim
