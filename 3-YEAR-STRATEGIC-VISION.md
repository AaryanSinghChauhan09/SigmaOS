# 🚀 SigmaOS 3-Year Strategic Vision Roadmap

This document establishes the strategic, long-term engineering plan for the future expansion and leapfrogging capabilities of **SigmaOS's core subsystems**, focusing on package distribution, system observability, compatibility standards, and high-performance real-time scheduling.

## 🏗️ 1. Technical Vision: Outclassing Mainstream OS Ecosystems

Traditional monolithic kernels and release distributions introduce architectural bottlenecks. SigmaOS utilizes **Zero-Dependency, Multi-Language Hybrid Shards** and **Capability-Based Sandboxing** to achieve superior security, determinism, and developer agility.

```
       +-------------------------------------------------------+
       |                  Sovereign Core Shards                |
       +-------------------------------------------------------+
            |                        |                       |
            v                        v                       v
   +-----------------+      +-----------------+      +-----------------+
   |   PQC Spec v2   |      |  SigmaTrace VM  |      |   POSIX Tiers   |
   | (Kyber/Dilithium|      | (Low-Overhead)  |      | (Modular Subs)  |

## 📦 2. Domain 1: Package Distribution & Quantum-Safe Trust (Rust)

### 2.1 Next-Gen Package Recipes & Trust Chains
- **Inspiration**: Secure Debian APT, Nix, and Gentoo Portage.
- **Future Architecture**: Package recipes will be extended with complete post-quantum cryptography (PQC) validation keys (using Kyber-1024 and Dilithium-5) to completely replace standard legacy GPG signing, defending against future quantum computing attacks.
- **Reproducible Build Pipeline**: Integrate standard build environment variables (such as `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` in compilation Makefile pipelines) to achieve 100% bit-for-bit deterministic, reproducible binary artifacts.

---

## 🔍 3. Domain 2: Low-Overhead Kernel & System Observability (Rust / Zig)

### 3.1 Sandboxed eBPF-like Dynamic Tracing
- **Inspiration**: Linux `eBPF`/`perf` and BSD `DTrace`.
- **Future Architecture**: Extend the observability stack (`src/observability/stack.rs`) with custom `SigmaTrace` sandboxed dynamic probing VMs, allowing developers to safely hook system calls and schedulers events with near-zero trace overhead.
- **Prometheus-ready Telemetry**: Automate the collection of memory allocators fragmentation and page-fault metrics to expose through high-speed, lock-free `SigmaMetrics` endpoints.

---

## ⚖️ 4. Domain 3: Interoperability, FHS, & POSIX Tiers (Rust / Zig)

### 4.1 Modular Compatibility Layers
- **Inspiration**: LSB (Linux Standard Base), Wine, and macOS Rosetta.
- **Future Architecture**: Implement modular POSIX compatibility tiers inside `src/compatibility/` where POSIX syscall assumptions are translated to capability-gated IPC transactions in user-space, avoiding kernel bloat.
- **FHS Overlay Symlinks**: Mount standard compliance paths (e.g. `/bin`, `/etc`, `/usr/lib`, `/var`) dynamically using capability-gated overlays over our distributed, immutable sovereign file system.

---

## ⚡ 5. Domain 4: Real-Time EEVDF & HPC Cluster Scheduling (Rust)

### 5.1 Hard Preemption RT and Slurm-style Clustering
- **Inspiration**: Linux `PREEMPT_RT` and HPC `Slurm`/`MPI`.
- **Future Architecture**: Tune the EEVDF scheduler in `src/kernel/scheduler.rs` with hard preemption paths for RT priorities, guaranteeing bounded interrupt handling latencies.
- **Clustered Memory-Bypass Routing**: Support memory mapped DMA bypass for MPI-based supercomputing clusters, ensuring microsecond message-passing latency.

## 📅 6. Step-by-Step Implementation Roadmap

- [ ] **Phase 1 (Validation)**: Complete core traits and verification tests for standards, packages, and observability.
- [ ] **Phase 2 (Parity)**: Implement real-time scheduling preemption gates and FHS directory mounts.
- [ ] **Phase 3 (Leapfrog)**: Launch sandboxed user-defined dynamic tracing engines and fully automated, AI-driven performance optimization loops.
