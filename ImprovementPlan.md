# 🇸🇴 SigmaOS Sovereign System Improvement Plan
## 🚀 Guidelines, Comprehensive Audits, Self-Healing Resilience & Next Steps

This document outlines the guidelines, systemic audits, and prioritized action items for the **SigmaOS** codebase. By following these steps, SigmaOS moves closer to zero-dependency digital sovereignty, hard real-time latency, and self-healing resilience.

## 📋 1. Architectural Guidelines & Best Practices

To maintain code cleanliness, high performance, and extreme safety:
1.  **Avoid Temporary Allocations:** Inside rendering loops, theme composition, or device polling loops, do not use temporary strings or vectors. Favor standard references or zero-copy `.map(|s| s.as_str()).unwrap_or("")` operations.
2.  **Enforce Capability Gates:** Every driver execution or filesystem mount must require validation of a `CapabilityToken` to prevent privilege escalation.
3.  **Encapsulate Security Bitmasks:** Never expose raw security bitmasks. All permission checks must happen through private fields exposed exclusively via getter interfaces.
4.  **No Dynamic Libraries:** Avoid calling dynlib/shared objects (`.so`, `.dll`). Every package or system layer must compile natively or run sandboxed in WebAssembly.

## 🔍 2. Comprehensive Codebase Audits

### A. Memory Allocator & Kernel Core
*   **Status:** Stable.
*   **BuddyAllocator:** Implemented with 12 free list orders spanning 4KB to 8MB. `calculate_order` is fully optimized with branchless $O(1)$ operations mapping to native hardware instructions (`next_power_of_two` and `trailing_zeros`).
*   **Scheduler:** MLFQ, CFS, and EDF models are defined. CFS implements fair execution slices; EDF manages deadline-driven hard real-time tasks.

### B. Driver Ecosystem & Dynamic Registry
*   **Status:** Under Active Development.
*   **OOP PnP Drivers:** Base polymorphic trait `DeviceDriver` established. Device families (Input, GPU, Network, Bluetooth) inherit and wrap driver implementations safely.
*   **Active Drivers:** PS/2 Mouse (`PS2MouseDriver`), AMD Radeon Gpu (`AmdRadeonGpuDriver`), Intel Pro Ethernet (`IntelProEthernetDriver`), and Broadcom Bluetooth (`BroadcomBluetoothDriver`) declare strict state hierarchies.

### C. Security Sandbox & Cryptographic Layer
*   **Status:** High Resilience.
*   **Capabilities:** Strict boundary checking enforces permission gates.
*   **Kyber & Dilithium:** NIST FIPS post-quantum encryption/signing secures kernel-to-userland message transit.

## 🛡️ 3. Self-Healing & System Resilience

SigmaOS uses active supervision watchdogs to implement a highly resilient self-healing state machine:
*   **State Watchdogs:** S6-style processes monitor the wellness of critical userland and kernel tasks.
*   **Merkle-Tree Checkpoints:** If a filesystem corruption or anomalous behavior is detected by the Intrusion Detection Shard, the system invokes a `RecoveryAction`.
*   **Sub-Millisecond Rollback:** Rollbacks are processed by reloading the previous known secure immutable state from the Merkle tree checkpoint.

## 🚀 4. prioritized Next Steps & Action Plan

1.  **Paging Validation:** Fully integrate virtual memory paging structures inside `klib/paging.rs`.
2.  **Universal Package Manager (sigpkg):** Integrate DPLL SAT solvers and CAS validation folders in `src/sigpkg/resolver.rs`.
3.  **Local AI Task Routing:** Scale the local MoE DeepSeek-R1 task router inside `src/ai/orchestrator.rs` with AVX-512 vector acceleration.
4.  **Sovereign Web Browser:** Implement a pure-Rust HTML5/CSS parser inside `src/net/browser_core/` to render content without foreign dependency bindings.
